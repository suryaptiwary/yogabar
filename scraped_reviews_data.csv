   It's very tasty and affordable and filled with all the goodies needed for your diet

  I really want to applaud the ppl at yogabar who come up with such great combinations, the perfect taste, they have mastered the art of what will taste the best with what. I’m so happy with all the ingredients and how they complement each other and taste great with milk/yoghurt! Best buy!

  Morning breakfast is now easy with this delicious crunchy muesli. Me being a fruits and nuts lover, loved it and it has all berries  which gives awesome taste. All healthy ingredients like oats, brown rice flakes, raisins, cranberries, apricots. Black currants ,quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax seeds, this is a combined mixture of all healthy foods. Just 200 calories and I am sorted in morning. Tastes best with cold milk. Even it makes a great dry snacking option anytime during the day. Perfect when you are on balanced diet and will recommend you all to give it a try.

  I'm a big fan of Yogabar range of Mueslis and order them frequently. I decided to buy the 700 gm super saver pack when it was cheaper during the great Indian sale. Got it for Rs 349. However, the pack was full of lumps rather than the usual consistency. It was really annoying as it altered the taste a lot. All the lumps were overtly sweet and rest of the muesli was dry and tasteless. Moreover, they didn't dissolve in milk and by the time it did, the rest of the cereal got soggy. I really hope it was a one time thing and won't happen again in the future. I'm still waiting to hear from Yogabars.Hope this review is helpful.

  Quality of product has deteriorated badly. The two boxes I purchased got ""burnt grains"". Also some of the seeds float when milk is put, meaning the company is now using expired items. Even the rasins are put like lump of balls...Only thing that is good is the packing... not the actual product.Anyway, this company planned that they will initially gain customer confidence, get good rating and later give 3rd class product.Very disappointing...

  It is crunchy n good,I like the little pumpkin seeds which r un4tunately less in it..I gave 3stars (see update) coz it's very sweet 4me,I dnt eat that much sweet,so I was drinking cold milk with it (without pouring the milk in it,otherwise it wud have lost its crunch)..the milk seem 2help cut down all the sweetness..but the sweetness is not from sugar,it comes from Jaggery that has been added 2it..I dnt love the taste very much,but I dnt dislike it either..if this helps me loose weight a little bit,why not eat it :-)I also got the dark chocolate one,will try it after finishing this1 :-)Try it out :-)Update-after 3-4days of eating this,I started 2like it very much (giving 4stars now)..if I loose weight, I'll give 5stars :-D

"
"

  I am finding someone to help me to finish the packet. This might have corn syrup mixed. extremely sweet by taste and a scent. Its really hard to finish the packet by me.

  This is a very good breakfast snack loaded with fruits, nuts, seeds and muesli which gives you long lasting energy for 4-5 hours continuously. it helps you to stay fit and lean without skipping any meal.Some of good things about it:1. It contains complex carbohydrates from quinoaz oats and brown rice. Hence, it will not increase your blood sugar level.2. It is very delicious and tasty. I bought strawberry flavour and I feel like eating ice cream.3. Flex and chia seeds contained in it gives you a good dose of fiber so you won't get problems like constipation.4. It is very high in protein so if if you're someone who wanted to build muscle mass then use this.

"
"

  I am a huge fan of yoga bear whole grain until i have received a package from Amazon, the flax seeds and the chia seeds are burnt, the pumpkin seeds and the oats are roasted more than required, they have become brown, the entire taste of the muesli has changed, the sweetness of the berries has become less, the amount of raisins have gone down, the size of the flat brown rice has become small I seriously don't understand how can a reputed and highly sold muesli not have consistency maintained. Very disappointed, now scared to order online as there is no return.

"
"

  I keep searching for breakfast which takes less time to get prepared and which should be healthy and tasty.This fits my taste well as well as fits my budget too. It's very healthy and tasty.

  Pros: On opening the zip lock package, the aroma was just superb. Quantum of whole grains 50% (rolled oats and brown rice flakes) and seeds 18% (quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax) seemed right and to my satisfaction.Cons: Quantum of dried fruits 22% (apricots, black currants, cranberries and raisins) and almonds is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.Conclusion: Overall, I like this muesli due to the main ingredients of whole grains and seeds and have ordered the seven hundred grams packet. To increase the dried fruit content, I have purchased the two hundred grams packet of 'Nutty Gritties Mix Berries' containing dried black currants, blueberries, strawberries and cranberries to mix with the muesli (I hope Nutty Gritties does not disappoint).I want to compare the above combination with Bagrry's Fruit 'n' Fibre, Mixed Fruit Muesli (consumed and enjoyed earlier) and decide which to settle for.Four stars for the main ingredients; one star docked for less dried fruits.

   This is a perfect beginning for anyone in the morning.It fulfills body and mind requirements in a balanced manner.1. Light yet filling breakfast high in nutrition.2.

  I like the flavour and it tastes good. Out of various muesli brand that I have tried, I like yogabar muesli the most as it has a mix of nuts and seeds. The seeds and nuts together gives a crunchy experience. I am going to buy it again. What I don't like about it is the carbohydrate content in each serving. It's quite high when compared to protein content and I guess my main purpose for which I switched to muesli (i.e., weight loss) is not gonna be of great help in this regard.

"
"

  The first product was awesome. The repeat order was super stale, thready and sticky.. It smelled like yuck

  I was using that product since last year, this was November's batch product but now this was look pathetic & smell is also change.  Why this looks sm reddish? Not worth of money

"
"

  Decently priced, but very sweet. People looking for healthy breakfast definitely don't like such a sugary cereal.

"
"

  First thing, the product is crispy nicely packed in zipper pouch. But I do not have good experience as regard to quality. It is for sure, not having 22% of fruit and nut. Which was the main reason for me to go for it leaving Baggery. Perhaps Yogabar people are intending to do cost cutting by adding less while promising more. I can not return as per product return policy.

"
"

  The one that I ordered was for Muesli Fruits but I was handed chocolate one little annoyed I was but then it was all fine since it was kind of bonus deal for me I got two packets of chocolate one for the price of just one and taste-wise it was superb, kind of light, a lot of healthy things inside my 8 yrs old daughter would ask for it, again and again, seems she loved it.I will be buying it again.

"
"

  It's been two whole days now and the taste of this cereal is so refreshing that I don't feel the need to munch on anything else throughout the day. Healthy, tasty and definitely smells so good.Oh and also, I totally forgot to mention, it uses flax seeds, which is quite honestly very rarely available these days but is so good for stomach issues, and the fact that it doesn't have a weird smell for all the mixed nuts is my favorite. Loving it. Gonna try different flavors next month!

"
"

  I am taking this in my breakfast along with peanut butter and protein shakeI love it's delicious taste and it is full of natural and healthy ingredients like Fruits, Nuts and museli Seeds, Quinoa, Oats and Brown Rice, Chia and Flax seeds . Being a gym freak it is a perfect Meal Replacement for me as it is high in protein and fibres ,I am fully satisfied with my purchase and  recommend it to all the gym freaks out there also I am thinking to try the other variants tooHope that they are equally delicious in taste.

"
"

  Artificial taste with taste of sugar. Didn't enjoy at all

"
"

  The worst dry fruits have gone bad and have lot of bugs or insects i dont know so disappointing.

"
"

  It's been a few months since I discovered this mueslix flavour. I've been buying protein bars produced by the same company for more than a year now ergo I know quality is good.This large pack is unavailable in physical stores and even though it took a whole week to be delivered from Bangalore to Delhi, it's worth the wait as the product is very healthy and price very reasonable.

"
"

  Very hard, full of Sugar.

"
"

  Overall a great product. The packet inside is resealable which protects it from moisture. Great taste. Although Baggry's is similar, I chose this as it contains chia and flax as well.

"
"

  A very good product with good taste along with great ingredients! Very aptly priced with great packaging. Best thing to carry to work which helps one avoid junk food when hungry. Excited to try other flavors as well.

"
"

  The Muesli is a perfect mixture of Wheat, Corn grits, Rolled Barley, Rolled oats, Rice & Dry Fruits & Nuts- 20%(Raisins, Almonds).It is filled up with Vitamins, Minerals and Antioxidant which is needed for you everyday just mix some fruits what all you like and the best dish is ready for you.

"
"

  Taste is like strawberry cream biscuit/waffers..not for those who are planning to reduce weight..Please choose kellog's Muesli fruit instead..it has better taste..if you are on strict diet then please choose Baggry's muesli which is plain and not sweet at all..Tried Yogabar once and going back to Kellog's..

"
"

  Received the product on time thanks Amazon 😘The packaging was good and no spillage at all 😁Abt the product =it is superb and delicious..This is my third order of yogabar muesli.. Its is full of seeds, flax, dry fruits..So tempting that i consume it raw without adding milk 😂😂..Good for weightloss..Good for breakfast..Shall be recommended 👌👌..P.s. The pic in the attachment 👆👆

"
"

  I personally don't like its flavour cause of mild strawberry scent, though its doesn't contain cornflakes at all , that's good part, but its hard while chewing. Before that i used Kellogg's musli with no sugar.. i think to switch back.. it's better

"
"

  This is the best muesli you can find in the market, and believe me, I tried many. Not sticky, very little sweetener in it, no sugar, no gluten... and tastes great.I don't like though that the product comes inside a big cardboard box. They could sell only with the bag and save lots of trees. It also takes too much space so I always throw the box and keep the muesli in the resealable bag.

"
"

  Terrible product. The flaxseeds taste burnt and ruins the whole flavour. Can't believe I haven't read a review which covers this point.Are all the reviews I read, paid reviews?

"
"

  Omg the worst meusli... I bought the packet and tasted it . The taste was so bad I couldn't finish my bowl. Now it's lying in my kitchen and idk what to do with it

"
"

  This is one brand that hasn’t compromised on it’s quality by adding cornflakes. That’s something am super happy about 😊.The mix of cereals and fruits n nuts are perfect. The chia seeds are a good addition. The quality has been as good as it was initially. Good flavour. The packaging is excellent too.

"
"

  It tastes, smells, and looks great. in fact, it is an amazingly healthy mix.  The price could have been lowered a little for a super saver value pack of a kg considering the wholegrains (though they are trendy and healthier than refined grains) logically incur no cost of refining and are quite cheap in Indian markets.

"
"

  It does not have berries and nuts only grains which is very sad.Overall it was not at all tasting good as it was used to be earlier.

"
"

   Yogabar is my all time favourite for healthy stuffs. I loved tge flavour of this museli+ breakfast cereal. It loaded with dry fruits. Its a complete fibrous meal. Most importantly its a gluten free meal. Thr packaging can be improved but its a value for money deal. Highly recommended for regular healthy breakfast.

"
"

  Received the product safely without damage. Product was fresh according to pkd date. I use it to slightly flavor my oatmeal in morning as it contains sugar in indirect forms like date oil, rice barn oil. So weight loss targeting people must limit this as it'll definitely spike insulin. Keep your sugar intake within 30g/day. Press the helpful button.

"
"

  Yoga Bar museli is the best in terms of quality. As I opened the package I was mesmerized by the sweet smell of strawberry. Also it has good amount of dried fruits and seeds. Just loved this product. Trying chocolate flavours soon.If you also get confused in the morning as what to eat (...other than simple plain oats...😑) then it is the solution. It's healthy, light and delicious. Just go for it.

"
"

  Who Doesn't likes Healthy Breakfast. This Yogabar Fruits + nuts and seeds Muesli is so delicious and healthy. Best food for Breakfast with an affordable price. It contains 50% whole grain, 22% Dried Fruits like Raisins, cranberries, strawberries,  Blackcurrants. It's a power pack break fast with High Protein and High Fiber .

"
"

  Great packaging and nutritional values, But the moment you receive your box, open and smell it, you will only smell preservatives and chemicals. I have sour throat because of excessive chemicals in this product within 2 days of use. Don't waste your money on such products.

"
"

  This is really the best muesli to have with good chunks of nuts, seeds, and dry fruits making it absolutely delicious along with oats and wheat.So, it's must try for a high fibre and protein intake diet

"
"

  Bought this as it is one of the very few muesli with seeds. I'd have preferred a more crunchy texture but it isn't so bad. Ingredients used seem to be of good quality especially the raisins but are a bit too large for my liking. The packaging is really good. The muesli is in a resealable pouch with one transparent side which helps check the level of cereal remaining

"
"

  Ordered this product few days back For a change! But I'm glad to say that i haven't got disappointed at all. As the name suggests it contains good amount of dry fruits,nuts and seeds and is really delicious. It's tastier, healthy and better than the other brands out in the market. It's available at a very pocket friendly price. The best thing is that this one do not contain corn flakes which i do not like at all and wanted a good replacement for that as well. I'd like to recommend this product to everyone.

"
"

  The product is much better than other brands because it is not overly priced and yet nutritious. It has a strong berry smell though which you will notice as soon as you open the pack. It comes in a zip lock pack so easy to store. More figs than other fruits in it.

"
"

  The Muesli had very little nuts and a lot of seeds. Some of the raisins still had their stems/twigs attached to the fruit, suggesting they were not cleaned before mixing. Didn't enjoy the product as much as I had thought I will. Big disappointment.

"
"

  This museli is so very tasty, you get the idea as soon as you open the packet, such a sweet smell comes that you become it's fan instantly.Now talking of the nourishment, it has around 10-12 GM's protein and good amounts of carbohydrates and good fats that keep you charge throughout the day, and preparing it is also very easy. Best suited for those who live in hostels or have to rush to work early in the morning and still want a healthy food.I recommend to buy this product.

"
"

  Morning breakfast is now easy with this delicious crunchy muesli. Me being a fruits and nuts lover, loved it and it has all berries which gives awesome taste. All healthy ingredients like oats, brown rice, flakes, pumpkin, chia and flax seeds, this is a combined mixture of all healthy food perfect when you are on balance diet and will recommend to all

"
"

  The product is best for my morning brkfast and pre/post workout. The taste is just fine, with the sweetness coming from natural ingredients. It makes a good rich in fibre, protien and carbs all in one snack. Hope it makes. Delivery by Amazon was on time.

"
"

  I have tried many mueslis available in the market but this one has become my favourite, as u open the packet u get this amazing smell, so I tried it with milk in my breakfast and it tasted amazing, no sugary syrups added, there were dates, seeds and whatnot they tasted amazing, I gave it to my friends and they were like crazy about a muesli could taste like this, must buy if you are looking for a breakfast substitute.

"
"

  Great breakfast option. My favourite is the chocolate version but everyone in the family prefers different flavours. They are all delicious and healthy. I'm happy to have found a great breakfast option.

"
"

  When you open this yogabar packet you notice fresh smell of fruits nuts and berries. Also the taste is Crunchy and fresh. Price is little bit higher side when you see this packet only contain 700 grm. This packet is only for 5 to 7 days. Try to buy at least two packet for your minimum 10  days breakfast.

"
"

  It is a glorious blend of rolled and toasted whole grain flakes with raisins, apricots, cranberries, pumpkin seeds and nuts. Made from 100 percent natural ingredients. Really loved the taste. One of the best muesli I've ever tasted. It taste so good. Perfect for breakfast. I usually ate this with warm milk. Totally worth buying it...

"
"

  Just too much sugar to my taste. Its doubtful if its all natural sugar or processed. It is more of a comfort food and less of a healthy food. The food should have been natural and not candied out in syrup. I was not expecting this from a brand that has Yoga in its name. Dissappointed

"
"

  Bad taste

"
"

  I actually wanted to purchase cereal bars but landed up buying the museli instead since the packaging in bold displays your label as ""YOGA BAR"". I would suggest that the packaging should boldlydisplay the contents alongwith the label so that the customer doesn't get confused by the label and the actual content as in my case.

"
"

  The product has immense nutritional value and best suited for the people want to loose weight.No cholesterol or added sugar.Fully made of whole grain  and oats.This product makes morning easy with no cook,deliciously crunchy muesli!It is choice to be healthy and this product is best for the same.The flavour is very nice. You can make it regular intake food to have perfect body.This will enhance the strength and gives energy before workout as well.This product is gluten free .Additionally has high protein content and enriched with omega3.Try and get the best results.

"
"

  I think it is good idea to buy also 500g plain oats and mix it with this yoga bar, or you will finish it in 4days, that will expensive. I just got it iam going to the store and buy the plain oats to mix. So I can enjoy for 10 days.

"
"

  Good product with strawberries flavour and best for the people who are in diet coz it contains good amounts of protein fiber and omega3 but the problem is a little bit pricy😄

"
"

  Not at all good product. It contains mostly puffed rice and low cost seeds with negligible dry fruits.

"
"

  I have been yogabar breakfast bars fan. So, I thought of giving the muesli a try. I was using kellogs muesli from a long time that tasted great but i was not liking huge corn flakes in it..So, at first the muesli taste was a little weird as i was used to diff muesli.. but second time onwards i liked the taste. It's great quality muesli.

"
"

  The product is good, nice flavor and priced a bit on higher side. The only thing which needs to be addressed is the amount of sugar inside the museli.If it can be removed completely, the product will certainly get 5 Stars from me.

"
"

  This is sooo good. I am not a fan of packaged breakfast items. But this tastes so good. My toddler too liked it. I have no complaints.there are enough nuts and berries In it. I used it with little milk. Can use few drops of honey if required. But I didn't. It tasted great on its own.

"
"

  This is the one of the best muesli I ever ate.The flavour texture are awesome. I don't need to add fruit also because the fruit is like to flavoured and the dry fruit also as a very fresh and the rolled oats and all material all seeds are very good.This is healthy for me and my whole family. I order for myself then I'll order for my brother also and my sister also.

"
"

  A wholesome breakfast! Yogabar cereals contain eveything it says it does. No exaggeration in that like Kellogg's. You could find pumpkin seeds, dried fruits, nuts  etc in plenty and not for the namesake. Okay to pay slightly higher price because it's actually worth it.

"
"

  Settled on this muesli after a lot of research and we are on our second pack. It feels healthy and nutritious and  tastes good too. We have it as a desert with yogurt topped with maple syrup and it tastes just yumm:)

"
"

  I have tried different Muesli brands. This one so far is the best one and more close to original Swiss Muesli. Too bad that it is not available in my local supermarket. I have to order this every time through Amazon only.

"
"

  my son is liking this strawberry taste alot.he is kin of eating it any time.i also like it's taste.best is that it's contain with dried fruits n seedsbut it's little sweet so i don't like it with yogurt but overall it's delicious

"
"

  I received the product recently. I must this is value for money. This is a very yummy meal that can be had with milk. Taste is just too good. It has a lot of different healthy stuff in it. Crunchy as well. Must buy

"
"

  Not that tasty

"
"

  This is the best Muesli that I have ever tasted. I am loving every bit of its  flavour and the crunchiness very much. Best thing that I liked about the product is that it is not only a healthy breakfast option but has no added artificial flavour or sugar . The right mix of oats, quinoa, brown rice flakes, chia seeds,other combination of healthy seeds and last but not the least has loads of dry fruits which make it a perfect breakfast for managing weight and cholesterol. I would surely recommend this product and it is a complete value for money.

"
"

  This the second time I bought this product,last time it was flavourful,but this time it doesn't have any flavour,and the quantity of beaten rice is more.charging higher price for such quality of product. This time it was the muesli was moist.

"
"

  YogaBar offers variety of museli's and must say this flavour is delicious and healthy. The presence of rich nuts and dried fruits along with cranberries, apricots and other ingredients make a perfect super lovely breakfast for me. It makes my stomach full and also make me stay fit. Thanks to yogabar for such amazing healthy food

"
"

  I have ordered this to make quick break fast to my Morning schedule. Its amazing filled with lots of nuts and seeds like flex seeds, pumpkin seeds, sun flower seeds etc it has so many good ingridents to make your body healthy. With goodness of rich ingridents it's good in taste too.

"
"

  Breakfast couldn't be better with this product. The museli is super yummy with lots of nuts and dry fruits. It makes it nice and crunchy .The best part the packing is nice , it comes with a zip lock so the crunch is also retained and museli remains fresh

"
"

  Love this breakfast cereal. Been having it for the last few months now. Very less sugar and nice to taste. The quality of the ingredients used are definitely of a very good quality. I hope they come up with some new flavors.

"
"

  It's a very good option for the calorie and health conscious and gluten sensitive individuals. It has rolled oat, rice flakes, dried fruit pieces, raisins, dried cranberries, chia seeds and flax seed. It's mildly sweet in taste ( just the right amount), crunchy and good to go with cold milk or curd. I also munch on it as an evening snack though! A wholesome breakfast option. Keeps you feeling full for a long time. My personal favourite!!

"
"

  The amount of essence is way to much,xan know artificial smell of strawberry added to it.Indeed got throat infection due to it

"
"

  All ingredients mentioned on the box like oats, brown rice flakes, raisins, cranberries, apricots. Black currants ,quinoa, pumpkin, chia and flax seeds are added in good quantity.The packaging is also very practical, muesli is stored in zip-lock pouch. Its much better than kelloggs and bagrrys.

"
"

  not healthy but full of fake candies

"
"

  This is for someone who would like to go on a strict diet. The taste of fruits and nuts especially cranberry will be something that you will crave for. You can add it to Milk, curd, orange juice or simply have it as it is. Yogabar has now become a known brand for Museli and bars. The Museli is really very tasty and crunchy, full of nutritious value and lots of fibre.

"
"

  I feel some ingredients are less effective . I do exercises and I feel the product contains more of rice flakes than necessary . The product being muesli should contain more of other things like oats and others , but it contains lots of rice flakes . Product being slightly priced but that one would be more of value for money of it would contain more of other grains and seeds and nuts .

"
"

  I have been having Kellogg's Muesli, wanted to try this one.. Though priced similarly to Kellogg's this much is much better with all the nuts and nutritious seeds. Definitely value for money.

"
"

  This is a perfect cereal for breakfast with lots of nuts, seeds and fruits... Tastes delicious with an irresistible flavour... Sure thing will be liked by all... Total value for money... No second thoughts before buying

"
"

  A welcome change from the standard breakfast cereals, great nutritional value and taste. Good quality raisins and cereals make it a delight to eat. Apart from having it in breakfast I use it for quick snacking which is healthy and tasty. Loving it.

"
"

  Amazing product ...i was using healthkart cereal but in regular it become worse in test but this is amazing test ...just go for it...i have brought many brands but found those cheater who put false rating ...but now found good one ..and I'm not writing bcz i have been paid...

"
"

"
"

  Good quantity of dry fruitsNice tasteMe and my mom Loved it ❤️Can use as a cruncy snack as itselfUse as overnight oats and chia preparationBreakfast tastes like a pudding 😋👌😍😍

"
"

  I've tried all the flavors of Yogabar and this one is my favorite one.The best thing is in budget and have a perfect mix of nuts and grains. A bowl in a breakfast keep my tummy full and energetic.

"
"

  The quantity of the museli is very good and it do includes alots of healthy nuts in it. The flavour is good, it is sweet in taste. It is surely a value of money & the packaging is also nice.

"
"

  It has lots of dry fruits.Good and healthy. It has sweetness to it so you don't need to use any extra sugar.  But if you want you can accn to ur taste.Its taste more good wen u mix it with cornflakes.

"
"

  Worst product. Taste is very bad... Not up to the mark.

"
"

  very satisfied with the taste, it's really a nice breakfast in terms of both taste and flavor, I generally have it with hot milk and it tastes really nice, you can really feel the fruits and nuts. I think I am going to stick to the same for the time being

"
"

  Very healthy and  Good product. Much better than other similar products in the market. I’m hopeful that no artificial agent is added  Yogabar please be responsible and make healthy products for generations to come.thank you.

"
"

  Pls try to provide these with some discounts so that it is affordable to everyone.. I love this product very much that I started advertising/sharing in personal 😂 so I deserve more discount 😂🤣

"
"

  Can have it with or without milk. Natural ingredients make it to must have it. I feel little more quantity of nuts are required. Overall a good product.

"
"

  This muesli taste very good , all the indegreants are very healthy, oats , flax seeds , carnberries , almonds , kishmish and many more things makes the greath taste and makes it healthy also

"
"

  tried several brands.. this one is the best so far.. be it taste, its yummy..  and what it claims to contain is true totally.. everyone likes it at my place and i have ordered a third  one now..

"
"

  worst product ever i got till date..got stone inside pacakge and it calcicum carbonate lead type..dont bought this product even a single penny not worth.

"
"

  Firstly, the product was delivered before the mentioned timeline which was very impressive.This was my first purchase from Yogabar and i am fully satisfied.One can completely switch to it for breakfast meal since it tastes very good and it's healthy too, keeping you fit and active all day.Not to forget, the packaging of the product is also very good . Would highly recommend to try this affordable and healthy meal. I will definitely try other flavors / products of Yogabar.

"
"

  Only rice flakes,  non existent nuts ....its almost like eating granola bar....kellogs muesli is far superior in taste and quality. Only seeds are differentiators.

"
"

  Found it bit expensive but its tasty and better than many muesli which tatse if sugar only..Only if it comes with sugarfree version(sucralose or Erythritol) it would be best

"
"

  Very good product its good for weight management and has good mix of ingredients.

"
"

  Writing the review after having the first bowl this morning. It is far more satisfying and tastier than the normal corn flakes. It's a healthier option with more fibre.

"
"

  The cereal is kinda bland except when you get a bite of black current and or raisins. so, you can add honey or eat it with sweet fruits like banana, papaya, apple, or berries. Although, Quality is great and even the quantity is good. It will definitely satiate your hunger in a healthy way.

"
"

  Product is good and easy to prepare, packing is good and hygienic. Only drawback is that it is slightly overpriced, otherwise nice option for eating healthy.

"
"

   A mix of healthy and nutritious ingredients this mueseli makes for the perfect healthy breakfast to start your day.

"
"

  Good flavour. Contains seeds & nuts.Looks healthy

"
"

  Received a faulty product , with red powder all over it , complete waste of money . You guys should conduct a proper QC before delivering a product.

"
"

  This is an amazing product, the packet is full of nutricious ingredients and they are yummy too. just add milk of your choice(warm or cold) and add this to it and you are good to go. everything is fresh and crisp.

"
"

  Yogabar stood out in terms of taste and ingredients when compared with other popular breakfast mueslis like Kellogg's. It comes with various beneficial seeds and dried fruits and is not excessively sweet which usually is usually the case. Would definitely repurchase this but it just takes a lot of time to arrive.

"
"

  Best buy on Amazon. .a great product to Kickstart my mornings . .anytime snack. .with all the necessary seeds and nuts a great combination.  .not a boring museli can have it with milk and a dash of Greek yogurt with some fresh chopped fruits . And your yummy brekkie is ready!

"
"

  It's really tasty and adds flavour to my regular tasteless Oats along with fruits and Jaggery.Being a regular user I feel its price (MRP) could've been less.. hope they'll do something good for Bachelors like me..The product is very fresh and adds jinx to my boring Breakfast..

"
"

  Very bad this timeCompany faled to maintain quality.This time I got with no dry fruits in it only Grains @ Rs.400 for 700g.

"
"

  this is a very good and amazing product who don't have time to cook breakfast, this is fast and easy full of nutrients better in taste full of fibers and protein raw nuts and much more.I recommend it for the best breakfast in a hurry.

"
"

  Sugar free but added sugar present

"
"

  Flavor is just awesome, full meal for healthy breakfast, with this milk hater can also consume milk because of this delicious taste, mix of 0.5 % seeds , 0.5% berries, 0.5% qinova and rest of all flavored wheat flacks, seeds, qinova and berries should be add more,but overall it is good,but cost is tooooo hight for this all mixtures so cost should be low

"
"

  Delicious bar that contains everything you need to keep healthy and fit. Protein bars are a great way of supplying your body with protein, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, minerals and are perfect replacement of normal meals. ... Protein bars are perfect mix of delicious flavors and superior nutrients.

"
"

  Taste is amazinggg. Best cereal ever! V nutritious n healthy . It has fruits n nuts n diff types of seeds which are vvvvv healthy . I love it with cold milk .The box looks so pretty .

"
"

  Strawberry flavour sucks..gives nausea feeling.. don't know how I'm going to complete full pack..no idea about other flavours but

"
"

  Very healthy breakfast option. All ingredients are clearly mentioned and they use jaggery instead of refined sugar which is very good. This is by far the best Muesli that i have tried. Will definitely buy again.

"
"

  Tried this product for the first time and it is really. A mixture of muesli, fruits n nuts. Healthy breakfast. Good flavoured

"
"

  An amazing product to start your day.Healthy and nutritious breakfast for the day.I have always loved muesli and i have tried a lot of flavors and this one is one of the best👌🏻 A must buy product.

"
"

  It’s really yummy & healthy with bits of cranberry & dried fruits in it. Tastes yummy & no sugar added I think. It tastes natural with bits of natural dried sweet fruits. Love it.

"
"

  Tasty and Healthy. No Sugar added . Gives you a prefect breakfast. Also beware that it should be kept in airtight containers. And Some insect might get inside. so keep in hygenic place.

"
"

  I have been a regular consumer of cerals over the past few years and have tasted quite a few. Viz. Dorset, kellogs muesli etc. Yoga is quite a healthy mix of seeds, oats fruits and overall likeable to the Indian palate. Would wish for a higher portion of fruit. Would rate it 4 stars over the other Indian cereals available.

"
"

  This is the first time I had muesli and I am in love with it. It's very healthy and tastes amazing, no need to add extra sugar in the milk. The fruits in it tastes amazing. It keeps me full for a long time. It's a perfect breakfast and super healthy.

"
"

  Its mostly cereal with what feels like artificial fruit flavor.

"
"

  Product not up to the mark nor its customer care.

"
"

  Im searching for best musli that contains low sugar and have natural ingredients. Im searching from last 3/4 months and I finally get this that satisfies my expectations

"
"

  It's good . Not excellent for sure. You would need to add sugar to make it sweet.Otherwise it's good.Bit expensive though

"
"

  Really loved this flavour of yoga bar muesli,color and sweetness all natural ingredients with good amount of nuts and berries. Have tried so many brands but this is best. A very healthy and nutrition meal to have in morning. package was fresh and we'll packed and delivered on time.

"
"

  Very bad taste and smell.

"
"

  Very good taste , healthy and amazing, definitely helped in adding some muscles on my frame when used with other good quality food sources like milk, and eggs. Highly recommend, would have been great if price was a little lesser since I confume 200g per day. Delivery took more than expected time.

"
"

  Writing this review after trying it for one week.I totally recommend this product. Taste is so good, especially taste of dried berries. At first try, you may not like it much but after trying 2-3 times, you will start loving it. You can add honey to make it sweeter.

"
"

  The packaging was good , muesli was inside the box in airtight bag. Its taste yummy and very health for breakfast. I love it this is my favourite flavour. I will more buy more in future.

"
"

  The bigger pack I had bought earlier had a lot of berries but this smaller pack has hardly any berries in it. Go for bigger packing if you enjoy berries.

"
"

  Good content, has many seeds and full of nutritional values. Also good value for money. But taste is ok but that's always the case with healthy items 😉😋

"
"

  I ordered fruit, nut & seed, got chocolate flavor instead. Like that too , so not complaining much. But avoidable mistake. And the order came quick in 2 days, Thanks for the effort.

"
"

  Nice productAS IT CONTAINS VERY LESS HARMFUL 3 SSODIUM ,SATURATES AND SUGARI LIKED THE PRODUCTDEFINITELY ONE SHOULD BUY THIS MUESLI IF SOMEONE IS VERY HEALTH CONSIOUS

"
"

  Added sugars into it, so it's does not aid weight loss. Completely a cheaper alternative at heavier price. Do not consume it.

"
"

  The quality of the ingredients is good when compared to commercial brands like Kelloggs. Will definitely buy again!!

"
"

  The quality and quantity at this price is unmatchable, compaire to well established brands of Museli.This is our second order and we are very satisfied with the product

"
"

  It is far better than Baggry's, Kellogs & a little better than Gaiaa. I highly recommend this & am buying this again for sure.

"
"

  I totally loved this product , both for crunchiness and taste ! The cranberries and raisins add to the sweetness and flavor ; while the crunchy texture of seeds are delightful ! It could have been more affordably priced as its a v healthy family breakfast option , and can be consumed daily .

"
"

  Every penny is worthfull in this product the product is marvellous in price, taste, flavours and presentation. The seeds of different plants like basil n flex also help to induce the flavour of product.

"
"

  Jus loving the product.the packaging it's very very healthy and delicious. I have never had a breakfast this good and yummy.can add taste if you add milk and a teaspoon of honey 😄

"
"

  I ordered this product for the second time. But this time its berries tastes pathetic.Totally disappointed. 😣

"
"

  OMG this is the best muesli i have ever tasted. No added sugar, but the fruits more than make up for the taste. Go for it

"
"

  Its a nice balanced breakfast. Just add milk. And you are ready to eat. Nice crunch of seeds and sweetness of fruits. You dont need to add any sugar at all. Starts my day well.

"
"

  Earlier their quality was too good but now they have decreased the quality...disappointed this time with the quality...and ingredients.

"
"

  Very good flavour, but the quantity will last for not more than a week.Everything is good, but cost wise not good

"
"

  I really want to applaud the ppl at yogabar who come up with such great combinations, the perfect taste, they have mastered the art of what will taste the best with what. I’m so happy with all the ingredients and how they complement each other and taste great with milk/yoghurt! Best buy!

"
"

  Quiet good and tasty breakfast meal.I'm not Dr. To speak about the health consciousness. But it's a good alternative b/f.

"
"

  This muesli is really awesome, you should try ones. Filled with seeds and flavour is really far better than other muesli. Packaging is also air tight, which helps a lot  if you dont tranfer it in a jar.

"
"

  Nice flavour and smell. A suggestion from my side is to let in soak in milk for 5-10 mins before eating. Way better than Kellogg's. It has more components too.

"
"

  I bought this product for the first time and I am very happy with its quality and taste. The packaging was also very good. It has all the ingredients that a healthy breakfast should have.  I will recommend this product to all those who want a quick and healthy breakfast.

"
"

  Its a healthy day starter, every bite has delecious flavour if we mix it with milk. I eat this corn flakes on regular thus I love it very much.its also ok because in this money we get the benefit of dry fruits and seeds .I started giving this to my kids as it is easy to make and consume plus they love the taste. Worth every penny spent...

"
"

  Expected a better taste for the price..

"
"

  I am used to eating Kellogs Muesli on a regular basis. Wanted to try something different. Yogabar muesli has a lot of seeds, nuts and fruit pieces in it. Even though it has so many different things in it, it still tastes good and gives a healthy snack option.

"
"

  Best Breakfast and post workout meal ever. Easy to digest and no after effects like Dizziness after having. But Dark Chocolate Cranberry is more yummy than Fruit and Nut. But still healthy!

"
"

  The taste is yum and crunchy . The fruits inside let me avoid the sugar in milk. I recommend it.

"
"

  Great taste most of the time u will find urself eating it straight out of the pack instead of mixing with milk.

"
"

  Healthy breakfast with rolled and toasted whole grain flakes with raisins, apricots, cranberries, pumpkin seeds & nutsVery Good smell and perfect tasteI am loving itIdeal for Perfect Start with healthy breakfast

"
"

  I personally liked dark chocolate flavour more but even this one is as good as the Chocolate variant in terms of quality and content.Its a great buy.

"
"

  This was a wonderful surprise in terms of content and taste in comparison to what I see in local shops. Thank you Amazon for bringing this product to my notice via your mailers. I will definitely try out their other variants too.

"
"

  Fresh and Healthy with a combination of fruits & seeds. Good choice for morning breakfast.

"
"

  I love it and would love to continue it changeing with regular  breakfast .i have only complain with amzone why did u dnt deliver the package prpoerly

"
"

  बेहतरीन स्वादिष्ट Purchased first time and was having apprehensions about brand and quality. But found it very good. Would defintitely challenge dominance of existing brands.

"
"

  I tried Dark chocolate and Cadbury varient as well as the fruits, nuts and seeds varient and both are delicious.It consists of healthy ingredients like flax seeds, Quinoa and oats. Perfect for everyday breakfast.

"
"

  This tastes amazing. It is packed with nutrients and fibre and is a really simple remedy for a healthy breakfast. The dried apricots and berries are like treats. The smell though is very sweet and strong, it might bother a few people.

"
"

  Bought this product after great reviews. But I did not like it much. It has a weird sweetness that ruins the whole taste. Maybe it's from berries. Rest the ingredients are a good mix. Can try if you don't mind your museli to be sweet.

"
"

  Previously used to buy Kellogg's.. but thought of trying this after seeing so many reviews.. I didn't liked the taste.. I'm totally disappointed .. I will never buy it again

"
"

  Nothing to say.... it's really best breakfast you can have... really tasty and healthy everyone will have it without any second thought.

"
"

  Slightly pricey but the taste is insanely good. Found it to better than most breakfast cereals.

"
"

  It's value for money... The flavour is excellent... Highly recommended breakfast meal...

"
"

  Product is full of chunks...not good..not by big 750gm pack ever...only buy 500g..it is betr thn biggr one..

"
"

  Smells yummy,  tastes delicious,  filling and healthy. Makes breakfast a happy event.

"
"

  Tastes good and healthy too.. a good replacement for breakfast esp. If work timings are tight for cooking a elaborate breakfast... i have it with honey, milk and dates syrup... love the combo

"
"

  I ordered yoga bar muesli after reading the reviews and comparing it with other brands.It contains seeds and fruits along with grains.The taste is really good and different than other mueslis. Price is reasonable too.Gonna try the other variants in future.

"
"

  Proper mix of ingredients. Delicious with warm milk - crunchy & full of flavour.

"
"

  Very bad taste

"
"

  It's too good muesli any another brands bagrry and keloggs yoga bar muesli it's superb blend mixture for healthy breakfast fruits nuts and seeds quantity quality it's best go for it without any high price brands

"
"

  I love this. It has every nut and seeds you can imagine. No inverted sugar which most brands have and smells amazing. The added sugar is Himalayan pink salt I mean the ingredients speak for itself. Totally worth every penny.

"
"

  Amazing taste, full of health, a must buy if health is your priority....best quality....loved it

"
"

  I feel it has a added color.. n taste is not good at all.Kellogg's is far better

"
"

  It was very bad in quality I saw small insects in packet smells yuksss

"
"

  Ibam definitely unsatisfied with this muesli,  I have heard a lot about this brand but it turned out to be a big time dissapointment. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Taste was weird as the quantity of oats was not even 20% of whole ingredients.

"
"

  Taste is gud but overpriced. Similar products r available at lower price.

"
"

  One of the most yummy muesli I have ever had. Be it's flavour, fragrance and most importantly it's ingredients, everything is just awesome. If yogabar will maintain its quality as it is, I will be your regular customer for sure. Keep up the good work!

"
"

  Well packaged and super tasty and heathy. Quantity and taste of the product is too good.

"
"

  The museli is good. Good handful of it with one glass of milk iss a perfect breakfast on the go.

"
"

  The flavour has changed a bit . Hardly any chia seeds. Ut used to be a great product but now more like the Kellogg one

"
"

  There is too much sweet components in here. You do get all kinda nuts and seeds, which is a good thing.

"
"

  Dey v smelling v bad

"
"

  Tried it for the first time todayFeeling disappointedHave everything they said but still didn’t like it

"
"

  This is the best muesli you can get in India, I have tried various brands. This is the only one which my whole family liked.

"
"

  It's not good flavor

"
"

  They have now almost stopped adding apricot and cranberry. Initially, the product was great and ingredients were generously added. Now, it seems they think they have established themselves. Hence the degradation of quality.

"
"

  For this little amount of protein i would not like to eat this tasteless cereal. It's sitting in a corner now, nobody ever touches it.

"
"

  I have tried several brands. This is the best combination of taste, nutrition and value for money. Just go for it.

"
"

  This is nice but i like the dark chocolate variant more. This one is a bit bland for my taste.

"
"

  This has become my go to serial. Whenever I feel hungry and feel like eating junk food, I immediately open the box and eat it with some milk. Love the taste, flavour.

"
"

  Good taste, the product is fresh with high amount of dry fruits. I recommend to launch 1 kg saver packs like other competitors.

"
"

  Product is gud but is on a costlier side. Very difficult to put in daily routine just because of price.

"
"

  Good taste for asian foreigner.I feel not masara fraver so tasty.

"
"

  Nice taste. The product is having a zip lock which has a tight fit. The fruits quantity should be increased a little more which seems less when compared to museli

"
"

  This product is very healthy. Even the sugar levels are bare minimum. Highly recommended.Considering the contents, it is really worth it if it is some 50-70 Rs lower. Hope the seller would consider it.

"
"

  Good diet product. But chocolate flavour is more good than this

"
"

  Best combination of ingredients lovely test and best for breakfast.

"
"

  Thank you for gifting us strand of your hair as a bonus. I suppose the cereal would've been great had the employee cared to wear a hat to keep food sanitised. Many thanks YogaBar

"
"

  This is the best muesli I've had so far. Full of nuts, seeds and dried fruits, it is wholesome, filling and very, very tasty. Moreover, it has jaggery instead of processed sugar that makes it all the more nutritious.

"
"

  This muesli taste even better then few mueslis of Switzerland

"
"

  A Perfect Breakfast Snack and the best quality and perfect cost.A glorious blend of rolled and toasted whole grain flakes with raisins, apricots, cranberries.Rich in Nuts & Dried Fruits. This one perfectly fits like one of my meal options.

"
"

  Not happy ... it doesn't has much nuts and it's not that tasty that I thought

"
"

  It's better to eat dry. With milk I don't like it's taste.

"
"

  flevor is not gud .......not like by my son......waste of money ....

"
"

  I used to be always in hurry in morning and skip my breakfast. It's healthier than cornflakes, no need of cooking and tastes better than other museli available in market.

"
"

  This is very tasty. Very good product and better than other brand. Quality is geninune..recommended

"
"

  Folks, I like the good quality of the product and what I dislike is it's a bit pricy. I suggest for the same price, they should offer 500g instead of 400g. That would be true value for money. Else it's fine.

"
"

  the purpose of getting healthy eating a muesli is crushed by eating this sugar loaded muesli.

"
"

  It tastes nice it's wonderful to have with milk and at a good cost I am planning to order some packets best quality and worth for money

"
"

  Value for money related to market. If price hike happens better available

"
"

  It tastes slightly sour and I'm not a big fan of it.

"
"

  Based on earlier good experience this was repeat order but this time unexpectedly bad experience with the product. The item as you can see in the picture is not good in this order. The expiry date though is few months ahead.Hoping for resolution.

"
"

  The product is filled with fruits and is a good value for money. If you like it sweeter then you could add some honey to enhance the flavours.

"
"

  A very nice healthy breakfast/snack/dinner product

"
"

  😋😋😋This muesli is best in class and quality...1st time I had this kind of muesli...I m loving it..😋😋😋😛😛

"
"

  This muesli is great combination of , almonds, berries, flax seeds, pumpkin seeds. It is tasty and highly nutritious. Must buy.

"
"

  Easy n Yummy breakfast without sugar n of course with a whole lot of goodies.Thank u Yogabar for this museli hope you guys won't compromise with the quality in d near future👍

"
"

  I received a recently manufactured product, about which I was concerned before buying. The flavour is good. Amount of dried fruits, nuts, various seeds is very satisfying. Best museli.worth the money

"
"

  This product has the right balance of seeds and dried fruits.

"
"

  Healthy gluten free Breakfast Cereal with good quality

"
"

  I love Dark chocolate and Almond/quinoa flavour. Fruits and seeds is my least favorite.

"
"

  Very bad taste I was not able to eat

"
"

  I ordered for my mother in law she found it expensive before ordering but after she received the products she absolutely loved it ,it was full of fruits n nuts wch is actually what is required,worth buying

"
"

  I have been consuming this muslie since more than 2 years and it taste the same all along . Awesome product worth buying.Try it yourself

"
"

  Taste is best and quality is good .. Don't think about go for it

"
"

  It's absolutely delicious. The aroma, taste and the nutritious ingredients just make this perfect.Crispy and highly digestive.Would absolutely recommend this to all the people who love nuts and raisins.

"
"

  Good flavour, good packaging and mostly value for money.

"
"

  Love it.. Great taste.. Very healthy and filling.. Packaging is good.. Amazon delivery is excellent.. I have been having this for the past 6 months now and I'm totally satisfied.. Thanks Amazon..

"
"

  Too many seeds very less fruits and nuts.

"
"

  Quantity should be increased ! It ends in a 2-3 weeks ..

"
"

  Recommended to buy. Super crunchy flavour... Yyyuuummmm

"
"

  The Yogabar wholegrain was good in flavour.it was nice product .we liked it so much that we bought 4 packets of this product .it was to drink it with milk

"
"

  Throw in some milk (I like cold), fresh fruits, nuts and you have a wholesome breakfast

"
"

  Very healthy option for breakfast. It tastes like strawberry and packaging is nice.

"
"

  If you're counting healthy calories, while being heavily dependent on quick breakfast fixes, this is where you search ends.

"
"

  Best muesli i ever had. Tastes too good. Not very sweet.. as in no added artificial sugar.. best part that is.. and it's just as they promised!!

"
"

  Apart from aroma, taste and variety i also like the thing that i get a recently packed item which one does not get it from the market.

"
"

  Superrrr dupper taste...  I ordered  it for a try and I think  m not  going  to  Change it.... Ordering  a big packet..... It's really  yumm... Please  try have all the nuts  ND seeds awsmmm loved  it

"
"

  I have been purchasing it for my family over a long period...it is far far far better than than other....at least you must have try it for once so that you will purchase it in regular basis

"
"

  Good healthy product with great taste.

"
"

  Healthy morning breakfast. good ingredients can be taken any time you feel hungry, better than having junk.

"
"

  It so good and tasty. Super healthy. A definite buy

"
"

  good taste, healthy as well packaging needs to be improved.

"
"

  Very good flavor and have alot of super food and healthy

"
"

"
"

"
"

  My daughter loves it. Will order again.

"
"

  A great berakfast companion. I love yogabar products. No Sugar and perfectly packed!! Once bought you might never change your mind for other options!

"
"

  Has good quantity of fruits and seedsHealthy ingredientsTotally happy with the product

"
"

  I have been using this museli from last one week.Its rich in taste and energy.It contains fruits,nuts and flex seeda,chia seeds which are high in proteins and fiber.

"
"

  Flavour.... GoodPresentation.... GoodV. for Money...  Price  bit on the high side, compared to other popular brands.

"
"

  The taste is yummy and crunchy.The flavour is too good.

"
"

  Go for it guys,it's fill your tummy for long time

"
"

  Costly and lots of sugar and sodium helps in increase weight and other health problems because of 5 percent sugar fo every 50 grams

"
"

  Very good product, it taste very yummy. You can go for it.

"
"

  The dried strawberry tasted nasty.Also there was too much strawberry smell in the pack.I think they have added artifical strawberry flavour.

"
"

  Kellogg's is far better in terms of taste and quality.

"
"

  It's my favourite museli now. It's the best I have come across.

"
"

  Flavour is great. This is the perfect food for breakfast 😋

"
"

  Better price and offer.. Much better that CornFlaks..

"
"

  Healthy, tasty, delicious. Seeds, strawberries, rasins , nuts , muesli. Perfect for breakfast or evening snack time. Packing all good.

"
"

  Item is good but delivered in 12 days even after being a prime member

"
"

  Although the product is a bit more on the expensive side, the quality of the cereal is really good and has lots of nuts and berries which are not sugar coated.

"
"

  Everything is perfect about this muesli, only if it was a bit cheaper 😁

"
"

  Awsum product....tasty and value for money....never tasted cereals like this

"
"

  Tastebuds were happy😊

"
"

  Product is good but not Value of mony

"
"

  I am buying it regularly

"
"

  Tasty & yummy , one can go for it

"
"

  Healthy abd tasty

"
"

  very crispy snacks

"
"

  nice flavour but too high a price.

"
"

  not as expected.

"
"

  Was looking for a healthy yet delicious breakfast since a while!This has to be hands down one of the best.It's yummy and makes me feel pretty energetic throughout the morning.

"
"

  Great taste. Very healthy. Go for it!!

"
"

  One of the best breakfast options specially for the once who doesn't have much time in the morning. This has more pumpkin seeds and chia than any other seeds and nuts.

  My stomach is full having this muesli. I like the taste but my daughter doesn't like the seeds which was coming while she was chewing.will try chocolate flavour for her.

"
"

  Much better than Kellogg's muesli. It's nutritious and delicious!

"
"

  Not atleast content shown on package berries are in pacakage

"
"

  It's very tasty & healthy, I replaced my morning breakfast with this.

"
"

  Taste wise it's 👌.. I liked it. Very healthy.

"
"

  Very nice muesli.Better than other brands.Value for money. Quantity of seeds and dry fruits is also good and flavour is natural . Go for it without any doubt.

"
"

  I have tried yogabar cereal bars and they were great, good quality ingredients and not too sweet. I stumbled upon their Muesli and as per Swiss Muesli style. It turned to be great.

"
"

  It's very much yummy and crunchy. It's made my breakfast just awesome 😋 But at such a price the quantity is so low.

"
"

  Just wow... better than other mixed fruit muesli this is the perfect combination.Suggest you to do not add sugar just take luke warm or cold milk mix Muesli and wait for just 2-3 mins and then enjoy.

"
"

  Yogabar is so natural and tasy .It's packaging is too good and new manf dateYogabar is available at very low priceAnd really very helpful for my body and health.I really like it

"
"

  The food quality is not upto the mark. I had a big stone. Highly disappointed for the money I spent on this.

"
"

  It has a strawberry smell. Healthy and light for brkfst . I ate even in evening 😂

"
"

  Very good 👍

"
"

  I absolutely loved it..highly recommend buying it..it is the perfect mix of all nuts,seeds...mix it once before each use..has strong strawberry fragrance.

"
"

  Taste- subjective. I like it though.Healthy-no doubt

"
"

  I have order two boxes and even paid amount for two boxe but today received ony one box

"
"

  It is best among all ...that's it. Hope in future they will maintain quality

"
"

  Healthy food and I will buy it again.

"
"

  Worst product.After using 1 time thrown in garbage.

"
"

  the taste is really good

"
"

  I go for difficult to find, no sugar, no artificial sugar and no honey products, so Yoga bar is a perfect option.

"
"

  My family likes this muesli very much

"
"

  I don't like test

"
"

  Taste really good. Nuts and seeds are in good quantity.

"
"

  Not up to the mark, it taste like normal flakes nothing special

"
"

  Good quality

"
"

  Very yummy, no sugar required also it comes in a zipped lock bag hence no storage issues.

"
"

  Taste is decent.There were some lumps present in the box.

"
"

  I received musli packat.but expiry date for mgf.

"
"

  It's the best breakfast... superb.. enriched with fruits nuts n seeds.. tastes heavenly... go for it

"
"

  I don't like the smell

"
"

  Bit pricey for every day consumption.  But good quality.

"
"

  Excellent taste andqualit..  A bit pricy though

"
"

  Was a bit stale.

"
"

  Flavor is really good. Packaging was not great. Good one for breakfast. High in protein and fibre. Value for money

"
"

  Healthy and tasty cereal

"
"

  Tried muesli for the first time and it is delicious as well as addictive.Thank you YogaBar and Amazon.

"
"

  The product is great in this price range. Tasty and have ample portion. I believed the sweetness outweighs the nutritional value here.

"
"

  Its an ok ok product.Not very tasty.Quality is good.

"
"

  add more nuts if for the same price or lower the cost

"
"

  after the bars , the museli is also tasty and  can be had for breakfast lunch dinner or even otherwise.  Good stuff....

"
"

  Very good item, I like it

"
"

  Definitely buying it again.. lots of seeds and berries in it.. liked the taste. .

"
"

  Yummy Taste, I like it.

"
"

  Found small stone in muesli.... Very disappointed on very first day of my diet.

"
"

  Not very attractive

"
"

  Not good flavor.. mostly sugar coated and less dried fruits

"
"

  Very good product, full rich of dry fruits, good taste and very hygiene than any other brands int market. Very very nice. I liked it.

"
"

  Did not like it much. Go for Good DIet meusli.  Better than this one.

"
"

  Excellent product ...the best available,

"
"

  It is high in nutrients and very tasty

"
"

  Loved the taste ! It is very filling. It tastes good with Milk or you also try with yogurt and fruits.

"
"

  I won't buy again.. Ingredients are not up to the mark.. Taste & Flavor doesn't has standard.. In this price, we can't expect premium quality..

"
"

  Is expensive but frankly noting in the Indian market comes even close. Larger packs making it more affordable should be considered by the brand

"
"

  Not so tasty but is healthy offcourse

"
"

  Very bad quality and also packing not good,

"
"

  Juyst loved it

"
"

  Very nutritious and tasty!

  This product has a great mix of flax, chia and pumpkin seeds, little less of cranberry.Earlier I preferred Baggrys Fruit and Nut, but after trying Yogabar found it extra sweet.So now using a mix of Baggrys and Yogabar.

"
"

  I have tried many types of muselis but this one is the best so far. Right mix of ingredients with freshness and taste. Liked it so much can survive whole day on this museli. Me and my son eat it everyday. And m happy that now we can get it in super market as well. Thanks to the manufacturer. First time giving 5 starts to purchases made.

"
"

  I have tried Yogabar-Wholegrain-Breakfast-Muesli-Chocolate....loved that flavor, so ordered this one.....but this one feels like i am eating paper with milk. Though its flagrance is strong and wonderful....but it will definitely  tastes regret every single time you eat it (Based on my experience)

"
"

  not that great just ok quality and taste. tried first time this brand not a happy experience. will buy different items now and make it at home

"
"

  Taste is not really good after first bite you won't feel like have again.

"
"

  A best meal to start your day with with misxture of proten, vitamins, complex carbs and healthy fats fats with seeds. I would rate it 9/10 its just that its certainly high in cost in proportion of quantity. If quantity was given as per requirement it would be 10/10.

"
"

  My sister bouGht this it doesn't delivered with the box after eating this she got rashes and boils in her body don't buy this product

"
"

  Request yoga bar to make bigger quantity packs like 2kgs in all flavours,Having Said that, we don't have to keep going to grocery store again and again and stopped our containers all the time

"
"

  I have always liked yogabars energy and protein bars, so when they launched Muesli tried it. It is really good and supports guilt free consumption as it's all natural..!!

"
"

  Super tastey😋😋😋😋 and full of dry fruits. Crunchy and healthy. Go for it. You can take it with both cold or hot milk. Perfect breakfast to kick off the day

"
"

  Amazing product, tastes good! A little less sweet and rich in protein. Can be used as a breakfast snack with milk.Go for it. It's healthy and tastes good!

"
"

  The Best muesli you can ever have!! It tastes yumm.. And you can stop falling in love with that flavor of cranberries  and nuts... The proportion of nuts:oats was perfectly balanced and it would be a great start for your day

"
"

  Excellent product way ahead then baggry & Kellogg’s, less sugar good packaging in ziplock pouch..

"
"

  It is the best muesli I have tasted n smelled...when u just open the pack n the smell u get,its  God level....healthy...

"
"

  This is an excellent dietary supplement for persons suffering from gluten allergy and autoimmune disease, coeliac disease.Can have It also plain without milk or yoghurt.

"
"

  Perfect muesli.. worth each penny.. wasn’t expecting to find such good quality muesli in India.. absolutely loved it !! Ordering more right away..

"
"

  Very less protien. 50 gm =  6 gm protien..  Bulshit.  Atleast 20 gm protien should be there... Protien is most important nutrient.

"
"

  I tried the 3 flavours fruit n nut, almond and quinoa and cranberry 1 .. trust me amazing taste. Makes my breakfast amazing♥️ jus love it..

"
"

  Very tasty

"
"

  Very nice taste

"
"

  Sorry Kellogg's. You've been disappointing with your taste but overcompensating by your marketing. You're out. Get better.

"
"

  Great flavors, generous inclusion of dried fruits and seeds. Crunchiest muesli with an amazing fresh aroma and packaging.

"
"

  Such an amazing healthy natural product. There are no preservatives or sugar in this and it’s so tasty. Good job yoga bar.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  The product did not meet my expectations since fruits+nuts+ seeds flavor but i was supplied with chocolate flavor.

"
"

  Not to be dramatic but yeah, this smells and tastes nothing short of heavenly🧡🌷✨

"
"

  This product can be helpful for diabetes. Pl confirm

"
"

  Its a perfect combination for all those who dislike the bland oatmeal diet..

"
"

  It is a healthy option for my quick breakfast. Like the test also.

"
"

  Loved it.

"
"

  I recommend all to try this. Its the best muesli ever.

"
"

  Quality is excellent, a bit costly thou

"

  Awesome

  I love this product. I found it in a local shop and it rapidly became my favourite muesli, reminding me of my favourite one that I used to get in Lidl (shop in Europe). So I was thrilled when I not only found it on Amazon, but at a cheaper price than the local shop.The item was delivered on time, as described, and I love it so much, I'm repeatedly keeping it in stock. It's oaty, with great amount of nuts & dried fruit to boot. I use it for daily cereal for breakfast, and my mother in law loves it with warm milk.Thanks again, Amazon - and Yoga Bar!

"
"

  After trying their chocolate cranberry variant, I picked up this fruity and nutty muesli from Yoga Bar and it’s even better! A perfect mix of muesli with dried up fruits, nuts and seeds, it goes well with cold milk. I enjoy it best with a spoonful honey or no sugar at all. The crunch is yum and it fills you up for long too. The fibre keeps my system light and the mix of nuts and seeds delivers consistent energy and protein. I’m happy with this unique start to my day and loving my mornings even more! Pick it up if you’re on diet or just looking for a new breakfast cereal.

"
"

  Tastes fresh, natural, no added syrupy sugarContains all necessary ingredients especially for a great breakfast(most important meal of the day)raisins, dates, oats, various type of seeds etc. makes the meal more rich fiber and deliciousscent-flavors, it's just awesome, just after opening the packet you will be in love with these muesli's-available at pocket-friendly pricing.Very good as they don't contain any sugar.

"
"

  Breakfast cereal is a healthy alternative if your goal is towards a healthy lifestyle and Yoga Bar is an Indian startup which provides healthy snack options at a very attractive price point. This is one of the product which I like otherwise. The assortment of fruits, nuts and seeds along with Museli and oats is a nice touch. The packet is quite presentable and looks interesting. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and would definitely buy again.

"
"

  Absolutely yummy and healthy. Not only did i but everyone in my family loved it. Best part is its available in other flavours too. Looks like this is going to be a part of my family breakfast and snack for a long long long time. Must try surely

"
"

  PPL who try this flavour will surely love this...It's as per description with its contents...Good with strawberry flavour and its aroma tempts to eat it...Though little high in cost, it is really worthy compare to other brands.You can opt for this for a healthy and tasty breakfast muesli.

"
"

  If you like slightly tangy and sweet bits of fruits in your breakfast cereals this one is definitely for you. Though I like the chocolate flavor more than this one but it's actually better in terms of the ingredients and their health benefits. It has pieces of dried fruits making it a healthy breakfast option.  I think this would make a delicious topping on yogurt.

"
"

  This is my first ever trying a healthy product such as muesli and I'm shook!!! The taste is amazing. I love the mixture as it contains a variety of seeds, nuts and dried fruits 😌I've heard a lot about flax and chia seeds, can definitely see why! I've switched my breakfast with this muesli and this is probably the best decision I've taken for my body in a while. 🙌🏼I like to have it with honey, fresh berries or bananas and some milk!!! It's quite fulfilling and provides the right amount of energy to Kickstart my day. 🙌🏼😌Yoga bar muesli has changed the game for me, can't wait to try other flavours!! 😋😋😋

"
"

  Got it a few days back and I was surprised with the taste and texture of the product. It's way better than any other brand. I could literally see the ingredients like strawberry, raisins etc. I could feel the crunchiness of the nuts and other items in the Muesli. Strawberry tastes awesome with milk and drops of honey.

"
"

  We really like this breakfast. Loving the delicious taste and the best part is that it contains all healthy ingredients like fruits, chia seed, flex seed, nuts, brown rice & Oats which is high in proteins & fibres. We are fully satisfied with Yogabar Muesli. Excited to try other flavours as well. Paisa Vasool Product.

"
"

  The perfect breakfast with a divine flavor of cranberries and nuts.Worth buying the product since it comes in a huge packaging and its sufficient for a person to eat a healthy breakfast and stay healthier.Loved it.It tastes amazing.

"
"

  I really want to applaud the ppl at yogabar who come up with such great combinations, the perfect taste, they have mastered the art of what will taste the best with what. I’m so happy with all the ingredients and how they complement each other and taste great with milk/yoghurt! Best buy!

"
"

  This is second flavour i am trying and i am really impressed by the taste and quality of museli...feels really tasty and healthy with all cereals and fruits...there is abundant dry fruit content...more than really i expected... really a good product for a quick and healthy breakfast or snack.

"
"

  Absolutely loved this and a big thanks to yogabar for giving such wholegrain breakfast muesli, fruits and nuts mixed. Being a gym freak it is a perfect Meal Replacement for me as it is high in protein and fibres ,I am fully satisfied with my purchase and recommend it to all the gym freaks..

"
"

  yoga bar fruits +nuts & seeds is a yummy, tasty and nutritious breakfast to the whole family. its flavor is superb, which is high in protein and fibre. it is good combination healthy and energetic whole grains in it.its value for money.... i would recomand to buy without second thought.

"
"

  It’s really good. It delivers on all the aspects. It has got it all what all is shown and what all is being claimed on the cover. Fruits, chia seeds, muesli everything. Flavors good. Taste is good. Totally a delight. Definitely value for money. Lasts around a week to 10 days. But definitely go for it. Chocolates good too. Except there are no actual chunks of chocolate how it’s shown on the packet.

"
"

  It's delicious. Cranberry and apricot adds taste and health. Grains like oats, quinoa and seeds like flax, chia makes it a healthy treat. I am having it daily in breakfast and enjoying it.

"
"

  This is probably the best value for gluten free granola cereal I have found in India. Very natural. No additives. Great flavor too.

"
"
